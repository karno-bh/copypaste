    CONTINUE:
        1. Writing OutgoingController
    Done:
        1. Added a daemon hasher for md5 files checksums
    TODO:
        1. Idea of the application is to divide the file to chunks. Each chunk will be requested separately. It will be
           a headache of the client to request the right chunk. [In general, the idea is to use a keep-alive of http.]
        2. Write Chunkenizer service
        3. Write a job that will calculate md5 check sums every 5 minutes since it will be a heavy operation
        4. check how to configure SLF4J
        5. Write javadocs
        6. More test...???
